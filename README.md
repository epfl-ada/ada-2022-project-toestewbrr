## Abstract üì∞

The [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) contains plot summaries and metadata of 42,306 movies and 450,669 characters ranging from 1888 to 2012. Love takes a central place in movies; the word love appears as the third most common noun in these summaries (after father and man‚Ä¶ #YOUGOGIRL). We aim to assess how romantic relationships are depicted in movies, by studying which two characters are coupled in a movie. Movies reflect the culture at the time of creation, therefore this enquiry can provide insights on how views on romance differ across time and across the world.

## Research questions ‚ùì

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the characters paired in romantic relationships in movies, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. How do the demographics differ between characters in a couple (i.e. age, ethnicity, religion, gender)?
2. Which type of personalities are coupled together?
3. Are there recurrent personality types among lovers for each gender?
4. Are there different types of love couples?
5. Has the cinematic couple evolved over time?

## Methods ‚úíÔ∏è

### General analysis
To gain a better understanding of the provided datasets, we first performed an exploratory analysis. We show here a single finding from this analysis, while a thorough description and many more results can be found in `general_analysis.ipynb`. 


#### Romantic movies

The figure below shows the runtime of romantic movies and non-romantic movies over time. From this graph, we first note that the runtime of movies increases over time. This illustrates that movies from around 1900 are often short, such as the [Dickson Experimental Sound Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dickson_Experimental_Sound_Film). Second, we find that, on average, romantic movies are longer than non-romantic movies.

#### Character personalities

As a first step to discovering the personalities that are matched together in a couple, we used the tv trope personality types that were part of the CMU dataset. Characters from approximately 500 movies were classified into 72 character types. When considering romantic movies, we obtained the top 5 character types that are displayed in the histogram below. For those wondering: the defining characteristics of a "ditz" are [profound stupidness or quirkiness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz).

</p>

Although this gives a rough sketch of the personalities, the classification of 500 movies is rather limited. Therefore, we will conduct our own analysis directly on the plot summaries to extract couples and character roles. 

### CoreNLP analysis

Next, we used the [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) natural language processing toolkit to extract couples and character roles from the plot summaries.

#### How often is a character in a relationship dying?

#### Differences in romantic relationships for older movies
