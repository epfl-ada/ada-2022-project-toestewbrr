    "The semantic scoring is done by using the [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) library that has pretrained word vectors for our semantic scoring. We aim to assess whether a movie is romantic. We (somewhat arbitrarily) choose to find the similarity between a movie and the word \"love\". Spacy can calculate the cosine similarity between the vector representation of \"love\" and the vector representation of a plot summary. The cosine similarity is defined as:\n",

First, the word \"love\" is a somewhat arbitrary choice. A second downside will become apparent later on."

    "In the previous part of the analysis, we have given similarity scores to each plot summary, which reflect how semantically close a summary is to the word \"love\". Now, we have to set a threshold to classify words as love-related or not. This presents a second challenge for this method. Picking the optimal threshold is not trivial. A threshold that is too low will result in many unrelated words, whereas a threshold that is too high will result in a low recall of romantic movies. We will show this effect here, by presenting the results of three thresholds. With a threshold of 0.9, only the word 'love' is classified as love-related. At a threshold of 0.6, we see more good words popping up, like 'feel' and 'like'. However, already at this threshold there are some questionable words, like 'think' and 'thought'. At a threshold of 0.3, there are too many words of which many unrelated to love. "

Note that we use the love-related words obtained from the 0.3 threshold, as this plot is mostly for visualization purposes and the lower threshold gives a larger number of words. Therefore, the data is less sparse. However, one can see that te cloud of points is not so dense. This illustrates that the threshold is too low.
