## Abstract üì∞

The [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) contains metadata of 81,741 plot summaries and 450,669 characters ranging from 1888 to 2012. Additionally, plot summaries of 42,306 movies are provided. These stories are a reflection of society and show our norms and values. So what do we learn from movies? In this datastory, we take you on a journey through time and space to discover movies through the eyes of characters. Which characters are most represented in movies? What are the characters most present in each genre? \
\
We also wanted to see how characters interact with one another. We decided to focus on romantic relationships as love takes a central place in movies; the word love appears as the third most common noun in these summaries (after father and man‚Ä¶ #YOUGOGIRL). We aim to assess how romantic relationships are depicted in movies, by studying which two characters are coupled in a movie. \
\
Movies reflect the culture at the time of creation, therefore this enquiry can provide insights about what personalities traits are associated with actions (ex: who are the characters in adventure movies?) and how they are paired together. By using the OpenIE and KBP annotators from the coreNLP pipeline, we aim to identify common personalities in movies and find frequent pairings among these personalities. Additionally, we will exploit the large time span of the dataset to study variations over time.

## Research questions ‚ùì

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the types of characters portrayed in movies and how character are paired in romantic relationships, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most common character types in movies?
2. How have common character types evolved over time?
3. How are characters paired together in romantic relationships?

## Methods ‚úíÔ∏è

### 1. General analysis
To gain a better understanding of the provided datasets, we first performed an exploratory analysis. Although we only present two findings in this document, a thorough description and many more results can be found in `general_analysis.ipynb`. 

#### 1.1. Genders in romantic and non-romantic movies

The figure shows the percentage of females in romantic and non-romantic movies over time. One can see that there are more women in romantic movies compared to non-romantic movies. Furthermore, the figures shows that there seems to be a decline in the percentage of females both in romantic and non-romantic movies during the first half of the 20th century. However, since 1960 the percentage of females has increased. This effect seems stronger in non-romantic movies.

#### 1.2. Character personalities

As a first step to discovering the personalities that are present in romantic movies, we used the provided TV trope personality types. Characters from approximately 500 movies were classified into 72 character types. From this, we obtained the 10 most common character types among romantic movies as shown below. For those wondering: the defining characteristics of a '*ditz*' are [profound stupidity or quirkiness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz).

</p>

Although this gives a rough sketch of the different personality clusters, only 500 of the 42,306 provided movies are considered in this dataset. We have therefore conducted our own analysis directly on the plot summaries to extract couples and character roles. 

### 2. CoreNLP analysis

[**CoreNLP**](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/) is an NLP toolkit with vast capability created at Stanford University. It runs through a **pipeline** of sequential textual analysis steps called **annotators**. The full list of available annotators is available [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/annotators.html). We will use CoreNLP to extract couples and lovers' persona from the plot summaries. 

#### 2.1. Exploring pre-existing analysis

The authors of the dataset performed a preliminary analysis of the plot summaries using CoreNLP annotators. We used this data to extract the main character and the characters' pair with the most interactions in each movie. We define the main character of a movie as the entity 'PERSON' with the highest number of occurrences in the plot summary; and the principal characters' pair of a movie as the pair with the highest number of common mentions within a sentence over the plot summary. 

However, using common mentions as a proxy for love relationships is a shallow approximation. Even if we restrict ourselves to romantic movies, the assumption that the most interacting pair of characters will be a love couple is too strong. Therefore, we decided to run a customized CoreNLP pipeline with additional annotators to extract more reliable insights. 

#### 2.2. Custom CoreNLP pipeline

We now use a **custom CoreNLP pipeline** to analyze the plot summaries. A complete description of our pipeline is available in the `coreNLP_analysis.ipynb` notebook. Our custom pipeline consists of the following annotators: 

| Annotator | Description |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. [Tokenization (tokenize)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/tokenize.html) | Turns the whole text into tokens.  |
| 2. [Parts Of Speech (POS)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/pos.html) | Tags each token with part of speech labels (e.g. determinants, verbs and nouns). |
| 3. [Lemmatization (lemma)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/lemma.html) | Reduces each word to its lemma (e.g. *was* becomes *be*).|
| 4. [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ner.html) | Identifies named entities from the text, including characters, locations and organizations. |
|¬†5. [Constituency parsing (parse)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/parse.html) | Performs a syntactic analysis of each sentence in the form of a tree. |
|¬†6. [Coreference resolution (coref)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/coref.html) | Aggregates mentions of the same entities in a text (e.g. when 'Harry' and 'he' refer to the same person).¬†|
|¬†7. [Dependency parsing (depparse)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/depparse.html) | Syntactic dependency parser. | 
|¬†8. [Natural Logic (natlog)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/natlog.html)| Identifies quantifier scope and token polarity. Required for OpenIE. |
|¬†9. [Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/openie.html)¬†| Identifies relation between words as triples *(subject, relation, object of relation)*. |
|¬†10. [Knowledge Base Population (KBP)](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/kbp.html) | Filters meaningful relation triples. |

Note: Due to the weakness of the computing power at our disposition, our analysis is currently restricted to 1491 romantic comedy movies. A broader analysis will be performed on all movies when gaining access to computing clusters.  

It was important to run this customized pipeline to have **depparse** and **KBP** annotators. These annotators allow us to find the characteristics associated with each character along with demographics elements. We also used the KBP annotator to extract relationships between characters.

### 3. Clustering 

For each character, we extracted attributes, agent verbs, patient verbs and tags (title, spouse, age) from coreNLP output. We then embed all descriptive words (actions, attributes, titles) of all characters into a high-dimensional vector space using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). 

We then weighed the word embedding of each word for each character by their cosine distance to the average semantic vector of words with the same type used for all characters in the dataset. The *cosine distance* is defined as:

$$\text{cosine distance}(x_1, x_2) = 1-\frac{x_1 \cdot x_2}{||x_1||\cdot||x_2||}$$ where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the vector representations of two words.

To visualize our clusters, we then mapped these high-dimensional descriptive vectors to 50-dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis to prepare the ground for a second dimensionality reduction technique. We now perform [t-SNE dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) on the pre-reduced weighted embeddings. 

Last, we applied DBSCAN clustering to obtain the clusters, which we labeled manually based on the descriptions of the characters. Specifically, we looked at the ten characters that originated from movies with the highest box office revenue in that cluster.

### 3. Findings and future analysis

The answer of the research questions can be find in the datastory.
