# Who is your soulmate?
## _Which characters are paired in romantic movies?_

## Abstract üì∞

The CMU dataset contains plot summaries and metadata on movies between 1888 and 2012. In these plot summaries, love appears as the third most common noun (after father and man‚Ä¶ #YOUGOGIRL). We aim to assess how romantic relationships are depicted in movies, by studying the two characters that are coupled in a movie. Movies reflect the culture at the time of creation, therefore this research can provide insights on how views on romance differ across time and across the world. PART REGARDING THE RESEARCH METHODS

## Research questions ‚ùì

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the characters paired in romantic relationships in movies, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. How do the demographics differ between characters in a couple (i.e. age, ethnicity, religion, gender)?
2. Which type of personalities are coupled together?
3. How often is one person of the couple dying and what causes their death (are heart attacks more likely in romantic movies...)? üíÄ
4. Is there a difference in the findings in (1)-(4) for older movies?

## Methods ‚úíÔ∏è

### General analysis
To gain a better understanding of the dataset, we first performed a general analysis. Let us show one finding from this analysis, while a thorough description and many more results can be found in `general_analysis.ipynb`. The figure below shows the runtime of romantic movies and non-romantic movies over the time. From this graph, we first note that the runtime of movies increases over time. This illustrates that movies from around 1900 are often short, such as the [Dickson Experimental Sound Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dickson_Experimental_Sound_Film). Second, we find that, on average, romantic movies are longer than non-romantic movies.

#### Types of personalities
As a first step to discovering the personalities that are matched together in a couple, we used the tv trope personality types that were part of the CMU dataset. Characters from approximately 500 movies were classified into 72 character types. When considering romantic movies, we obtained the top 5 character types that are displayed in the histogram below. For those wondering: the defining characteristics of a "ditz" are [profound stupidness or quirkiness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz). 

Although this gives a rough sketch of the personalities, the classification of 500 movies is rather limited. Therefore, ..... CORENLP EXPLANATION RELATED TO THIS
