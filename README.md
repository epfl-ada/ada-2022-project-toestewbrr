# How are relationships depicted in movies? 

## Motivation 

Love appears as the third most common noun in the plot summaries (after father and manâ€¦#YOUGOGIRL). Love has a central place in movies regardless of their genres and hence movies highly contribute to our idea of what a romantic relationship should be. We want to know how relationships are portrayed in movies by looking specifically at the characters portrayed in romance movies. 
WHAT DO WE WANT TO ANSWER? 

## Research questions 

* What is the evolution of relationship through time? 
* What is the social status of each character involved in the relationship? (too hard for the given amount of time) 
* What are their characteristics (smart, wealthy, beautiful)? 
* Who does the relationship benefit? 
* Is it a happy/violent/short relationship? How does the relationship end? 

## Methods 

* Cluster relationships and characters
 * ex: are there more personas with x characteristic in y type of relation
* General analysis
* Find plot summaries which contain most love related words 
* Extract information about each character (job, physical details, qualities, actions) using NLP Core on plot summaries 
* Create pairs dataframe which contain the pairs of characters which are in a romantic relationship in a movie 
* Plots: clouds/clusters. Clustering of the characters based on their features. Map each character in a loving relationship on a map based on the textual vector. Get a vector from word-to-vec from all characteristics and map it. Show the link between two characters. 
* Find dataset online which maps main components of each character
* Find type of relationships. 

## Proposed timeline 
* November 19: Redefine subject ideas and submission of milestone and wordvec working
* November 25: Relationship pairs and corresponding attributes dataset
* December 2: Analysis on the relationship dataset
* December 9: Imagine and create graphs 
* December 16: 
  * Code finished and commented 
  * Full draft of the website (website is working, summary of how we are going to write the story, having all graphs available) 
  * (bonus) Interactive plots
* December 23: Hand-in the project 

## Organization within the team 

## Questions
