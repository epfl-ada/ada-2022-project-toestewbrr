# Who is your soulmate? (according to movies..)

## Motivation 

Love appears as the third most common noun in the plot summaries (after father and manâ€¦#YOUGOGIRL). Love has a central place in movies regardless of their genres and hence movies highly contribute to our idea of what a romantic relationship should be. 
We want to obtain information about characters which are involved in a relationship in romance movies. 
Using NLP Core on plot summaries, we aim to extract information about each character (job, physical details, qualities, actions). 
The goal is to answer the following questions: 
* What is the social status of each character involved in the relationship? 
* Is there a systemic difference? 
* What are their characteristics (smart, wealthy, beautiful)? 
* Who does the relationship benefit? 
* Is it a happy/violent/short relationship? How does the relationship end?
