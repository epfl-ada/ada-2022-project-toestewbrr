# Who is your soulmate?
## _Which characters are paired in romantic movies?_
Toestewbrr üç≤ ü¶∂ : Antoine Bonnet, Hugo Bordereaux, Alexander Sternfeld & Marguerite Thery

## Abstract üì∞

The CMU dataset contains plot summaries and metadata on movies between 1888 and 2012. In these plot summaries, love appears as the third most common noun (after father and man‚Ä¶ #YOUGOGIRL). We aim to assess how romantic relationships are depicted in movies, by studying the two characters that are coupled in a movie. Movies reflect the culture at the time of creation, therefore this research can provide insights on how views on romance differ across time and across the world. PART REGARDING THE RESEARCH METHODS

## Research questions ‚ùì

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the characters paired in romantic relationships in movies, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. How do the demographics differ between characters in a couple (i.e. age, ethnicity, religion, gender)?
2. Which type of personalities are coupled together?
3. How often is one person of the couple dying and why is the cause of their death (are heart attacks more likely...)? üíÄ
4. Is there a difference in the findings in (1)-(4) for older movies?

## Methods ‚úíÔ∏è

### General analysis
To gain a better understanding of the dataset, we first performed a general analysis. Let us highlight two findings from this analysis, while a thorough description and many more results can be found in `general_analysis.ipynb`. The figure below shows the runtime of romantic movies and non-romantic movies over the time.

### CoreNLP to analyze relationships
Explanation: meaning

#### Differences in demographic within a couple
Marguerite

#### Types of personalities
TV tropes as preliminarie, explain with coreNLP

#### How often is a character in a relationship dying?
Histogram with main causes of dying

#### Differences in romantic relationships for older movies
Explain how we will analyze it; show difference from gen analysis

#### Differences over time
* Type of characters and type of relationships 
  * ex: are there more personas with x characteristic in y type of relation
* Find plot summaries which contain most love related words 
* Extract information about each character (job, physical details, qualities, actions) using NLP Core on plot summaries 
* Create pairs dataframe which contain the pairs of characters which are in a romantic relationship in a movie 
* Plots: clouds/clusters. Clustering of the characters based on their features. Map each character in a loving relationship on a map based on the textual vector. Get a vector from word-to-vec from all characteristics and map it. Show the link between two characters. 
* Find dataset online which maps main components of each character
* Find type of relationships. 

## Proposed timeline ‚è≤Ô∏è
* 19-11-2022: Submit the second milestone
* 25-11-2022: Have paired characters with their corresponding characteristics
* 02-12-2022: Analyze the relationships between the characters
* 09-12-2022: Start creating the visualizations for the website 
* 16-12-2022: 
  * Code finished and commented 
  * A full first draft of the website, with all graphs available 
  * Time-permitting: interactive plots
* 23-12-2022: Hand-in the project

## Questions for the TA ‚ùî
* Find a way to label the characters or the relationships?
