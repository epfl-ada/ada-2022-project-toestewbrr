    "[**CoreNLP**](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/) is an incredible natural language processing toolkit created at Stanford University. CoreNLP is applied through a **pipeline** of sequential analysis steps called annotators. The full list of available annotators is available [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/annotators.html). \n",

    "*\"CoreNLP is your one stop shop for natural language processing in Java! CoreNLP enables users to derive linguistic annotations for text, including token and sentence boundaries, parts of speech, named entities, numeric and time values, dependency and constituency parses, coreference, sentiment, quote attributions, and relations. CoreNLP currently supports 8 languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Spanish.\"* \n",
