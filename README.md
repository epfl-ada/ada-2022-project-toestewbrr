# Who is your soulmate? (according to movies..)

## Motivation 

Love appears as the third most common noun in the plot summaries (after father and manâ€¦#YOUGOGIRL). Love has a central place in movies regardless of their genres and hence movies highly contribute to our idea of what a romantic relationship should be. We want to know how relationships are portrayed in movies by looking specifically at the characters portrayed in romance movies. 

## Research questions 

* What is the social status of each character involved in the relationship? 
* Is there a systemic difference? 
* What are their characteristics (smart, wealthy, beautiful)? 
* Who does the relationship benefit? 
* Is it a happy/violent/short relationship? How does the relationship end? 

## Methods 

* General analysis
* Find plot summaries which contain most love related words 
* Extract information about each character (job, physical details, qualities, actions) using NLP Core on plot summaries 
* Create pairs dataframe which contain the pairs of characters which are in a romantic relationship in a movie
