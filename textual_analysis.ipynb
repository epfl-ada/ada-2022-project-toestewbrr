    "In the previous part of the analysis, we have given similarity scores to each plot summary, which reflect how semantically close a summary is to the word \"love\". Now, we have to set a threshold to classify words as love-related or not. This presents a second challenge for this method. Picking the optimal threshold is not trivial. A threshold that is too low will result in many unrelated words, whereas a threshold that is too high will result in a low recall of romantic movies. We will show this effect here, by presenting the results of three thresholds. With a threshold of 0.9, only the word 'love' is classified as love-related. At a threshold of 0.6, we see more good words popping up, like 'feel' and 'like'. However, already at this threshold there are some questionable words, like 'think' and 'thought'. At a threshold of 0.3, there are too many words of which many unrelated to love. "
